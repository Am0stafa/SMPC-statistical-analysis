# what is SMPC
 It is a subfield within cryptography that deals with allowing parties to compute a function over their inputs, ensuring that each participant doesn't reveal any more about their input than can be inferred from the output. In other words, parties can jointly compute a function without revealing their individual inputs to each other.
